# Micromouse
This project was done for participating in International Micromouse Competition organized by
TechFest2019-20 at IIT Bombay. It is
the furtherance of the Tremaux algorithm by employing a potential value algorithm in onjunction, for improving search in a micromouse.  he fused algorithm running on the STM32 Bluepill icrocontroller explores and finds the shortest path in a 16x16 maze. Proximity sensors, gyroscope, and agnetometer together with encoder motors aid the micromouse to understand its surrounding hindrances and ake precise movements while traversing through a maze. The optimized algorithm eliminates any paths that may ead the micromouse further away from the center of the maze during the initial run itself and saves a significant mount of time while solving a maze.

## Flow Chart of the Optimized Algorithm

Here are the three different versions of micromouse designed and fabricated. The bot at the center was used during the IMC-2020.
